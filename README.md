Maze generator & Pathfinding visualizer

A small Swing app that generates a maze, visualizes it being carved, and lets you run DFS or BFS to find/animate a path 
BFS can also reconstruct and display the shortest path.

How to use it:
Assuming you have java installed you can simply

Put the .java files (Main.java, Pathfinder.java) into the same folder.
Run these in the command line (powershell)
cd <directory-path>
javac Main.java
javac Pathfinder.java
java Main

This will run it without needing an IDE

If you have an IDE you can just pop the files in there and run it.
